# Data of Numerical Experiments of the paper entitled "Distributionally robust stochastic programs with side information based on trimmings"

## Goals

The aim of this repository is to provide the details of the numerical experiments used in the paper [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10592). This article have been developed by some members of the [OASYS group](https://sites.google.com/view/groupoasys/home) thanks to the funding of the project [Flexanalytics](https://groupoasysflexanalytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We suggest you to visit the related links to know more our research.

## Contents

This repository includes the data about the two test problems used in the paper:

- Single-item Newsvendor problem with side information:

  * [singlenewsvendor_generation_data]: This folder contains the data used in the numerical experiments section. The file entitled ""   . The files "indices+str(N)".csv contains the 400 samples' index of size N, that is, each row (total=400) of the .csv file represents a sample of size N. The points of the bivariate distribution are in the file entitled ""  . The rest of the parameters are described in [[1]].

- Portfolio allocation problem with side information.

  * [portfolio_generation_data]:  This folder con
